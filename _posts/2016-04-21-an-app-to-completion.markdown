So, yesterday, after finishing the front-end to interface with my simple Linked List script, I've started thinking
that I don't have any applications on my [Github](https://github.com/TiagoJMartins) that have both a front-end and a
back-end.
I've realized that I needed to create something like that, from start to finish, and I've figured I'd put in a friendly
time limit aswell, so I set out to create a to-do list application (clich√© I know) in under a day.

It was honestly a very nice experience since I simply planned it out in my head and started coding. Everything went
better than expected.
There were some hiccups and I admit there is some rubber duck programming in there, but I'm aware the methods I used
wouldn't be used on a production application. For instance, the /delete/ route is called using the GET verb...

So yeah, REST API and best practices aside, all I wanted to achieve with this app was a proof of concept that I'm
perfectly capable of creating a very simple CRUD application in less than a day without any tutorials or videos that
I can copy code from. With one day and access to documentation, I can create a simple Node.js application from the
server to the front-end view. That in itself means a lot to me, it means I'm improving substantially, especially
taking in mind that I stopped programming for a while this past month.

The app's source code can be found on my Github profile, linked above and on the footer of this page and, as a bonus,
I hosted it on c9.io but it hibernates pretty often, although I should start using Heroku for deploying these kinds of applications and c9 when I need
to actually work on them without access to my main development environment.
