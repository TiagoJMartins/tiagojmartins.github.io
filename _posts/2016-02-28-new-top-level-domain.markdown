I haven't been updating this blog much, or even working on the application I mentioned in the previous blog post, however, it was all for
a good reason since I have been devoting my time to customizing and improving this blog.

Along with a new "Portfolio" area of the website, which will probably me moved to a sub-level domain in the future, I acquired
[tiagomartins.xyz](http://tiagomartins.xyz) and made use of Github Pages' feature to include a custom domain! Now I've got free hosting,
security through Cloudflare's free plan and in the future, a dedicated personal email!

All of this is pretty new to me, however, it's giving me valuable insight into how the web actually works. I got into a few problems
setting up the CNAME file and the nameservers and all that, but after a few Google searches, I fixed it up pretty quickly and now it's
working perfectly!

I will continue to improve the website a bit until I'm satisfied with the result. Only after that will I start working on projects to
fill my portfolio with, until then, this is my sole project I guess.
