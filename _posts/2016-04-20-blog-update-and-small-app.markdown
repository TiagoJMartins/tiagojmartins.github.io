I realize I haven't been updating this blog very much, or even working on my portfolio. Things have been going pretty slow and 
with some recent personal problems in my life, I have been slowing down a bit. I'm hoping however, to gradually speed up and start 
working again on these projects.  

Yesterday I asked the help of someone very dear to me to choose a color scheme for my blog, I couldn't for the life of me settle on a choice
so I thought it would be better to ask the help of someone I trust to do it for me. I'm quite happy with the color scheme and I will leave it
how it is meanwhile. Even if the design changes, I will keep the colors. :) 

I want to also talk about an implementation I made of a Singly-Linked List, I realized life isn't just jQuery and AJAX calls so I went out to learn 
some data structures, starting with Linked Lists, I've created a very simple implementation using Javascript and made an even simpler front-end to interact
with it. It can be found [right here](http://www.tiagomartins.xyz/Singly-Linked-List/). 

I have also been contacted by a consulting company I applied for a few months ago with an opportunity to interview for a local web development company. Those
are really good news and I plan of giving it my best! I won't talk too much about it though, I might jynx it. 

I'll try to keep this posted!
