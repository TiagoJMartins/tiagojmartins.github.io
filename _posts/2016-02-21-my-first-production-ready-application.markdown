I’ve always wanted to control my income and expenses more closely. By following [/r/personalfinance](http://personalfinance.reddit.com), I quickly found some Excel spreadsheets that would help me in doing so, however, I tried to find a better way, since maintaining a spreadsheet was too much hassle. Searching Google for some budgeting applications, I found several solutions, both web-based and mobile-based, and even hybrids with synchronization between devices.

While there were definitely a lot of different applications, most of them essentially did the same thing. They provided you with an interface to insert expenses and income, they would manage that data for you and let you know where you were spending your money. Some applications gave you the ability to budget, which means that if you provided it with income, it would allow you to set projected expenses on your money so you could better manage it. While there is no shortage of personal finance applications out there, I’ve tried most of them and never really fell in love with any. Some were too bloated, while some were too simple. I wanted some way to input my income and the app would automatically learn my habits like daily or monthly expenses. All of those would need to be set up manually. As a result, I’m setting out to creating my own money management application. As the old saying goes, if you want something done right, you must do it yourself.

I’m still learning the ropes of web development though, and it may definitely will prove a challenge. However, I will use this opportunity, the lack of an application I truly want to use, to create my own app, from concept, to development, to testing and finally production. It will be my first production ready application and I want to later release a simple Android companion app to integrate with the web application.

While this is going to be a challenge, I’m sure I can make it, even though it may take me a while. In the end, I know I would have gained some valuable real-world experience in getting an application to production, along with all the obstacles I will face along the way. I will try to plan out the most I can, while not sacrificing action.
