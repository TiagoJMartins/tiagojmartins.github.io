I got invited to visit [Scytale's](http://www.scytale.pt) offices and work with them for three days! It was an awesome experience, they took care of all the logistics
of the trip and I got to work on a project for a real client, with a real team!
So, my stay in Braga was awesome, it's a beautiful city, especially at night, there is a calm feeling about Braga's night which is so awesome! Everyone was nice and
friendly, which made my stay even better!

After the three days were over, I was to be expecting an answer from the CEO of whether I'd be hired or not.
I got very good feedback the whole time I was there, which is good. They seemed interested when I left and I was happy I might have a chance at working at a real
Web Development company! If I do, I'll finally be able to get my life back on track, finish my degree and get my way overdue driver's license! All in good time though.

Anyway, I got offered the job and will be helping them throughout the next two weeks until everything is set up. By then I'll have to get everything ready to move and
I'll be living at a new city, with new people, ready to create new experiences and dive into the world of professional WebDev!

All in all it's been an awesome journey and I'm still far from the end! There is a lot more to learn, a lot more projects to create and a lot more headaches to endure!

Apart from all that, I didn't really have the chance to share this simple [Canvas interactive plaything](http://www.tiagomartins.xyz/Points/) that I've created. It was
made to dive into the Canvas API which I found really interesting. I've always been intrigued by Computer Graphics and I'd say the Canvas API is as simple as it gets.
I'll probably be creating some more of these small interactive pages, coding them are good time killers and you get to dive into a whole world of vector math and
algorithms, which is always fun, right?
