I figure the best way to start a development blog would be with a Hello World post.


This blog will be aimed at documenting my experience and growth in web development, along with updates on current personal projects, turning it basically into the journal of an aspiring web developer.


Updates soon to come, along with the first post about my current project that I will be using to learn React and the Flux architecture.
