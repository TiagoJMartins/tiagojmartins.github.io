I've been constantly working on this website for the past couple of days, trying to improve it the best way I could, however, 
I think that it's time to take a break from the general blog styling and start working on my portfolio.I

I don't have any work to actually put on it, aside from this blog, though I expect to get to work on some projects once I'm satisfied with the 
overall layout of both my portfolio and this blog. The development will be public and each "complete" change I make will be pushed to the repo in order
to make it into production.

I feel that developing my portfolio this early, will actually give me some experience and valuable insight required to actually complete some stand-alone 
projects. Here's hoping that works out.

I plan to work exclusively on the portfolio for the next few days and once it's finished, I will make it the front-page for this domain, moving the blog under "blog.tiagomartins.xyz".
