# Missing Brackets

Missing Brackets is my personal blog/portfolio.
It makes use of Github Pages for hosting, aswell as Jekyll for static-site generation.

All of the website is currently in early-development while I customize most of it's features.

# Current to-do

- Create a custom mobile navigation. It currently uses Jekyll's default and I honestly find it very ugly.
- Whole portfolio needs to be created.
